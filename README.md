Welcome to my LAMP application, designed to make my life and my girlfriend's communication more organized! The app was created for us, as we often share links with each other but find ourselves losing them in the endless stream of family chats and emails.

With my app, I can easily save and categorize links to various websites, making them easy to access and find whenever I need them. The app includes a user login system, ensuring that only my girlfriend and I have access to our saved links.

The app is built on a LAMP stack, using MariaDB as the database management system, and is hosted on an EC2 free tier instance. I've also included a user data script to make launching the app as easy as possible.
